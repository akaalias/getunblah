I"Ê<p>Hey and welcome, Alexis here.</p>

<p>Great to have you, letâ€™s jump right in getting you set up.</p>

<h2 id="installation-1-minute">Installation (1 minute)</h2>
<p>If anything, Unblah is just like any other macOS app that you download and install directly from a developer (like me) instead of the App Store.</p>

<p>After youâ€™ve <a href="https://github.com/akaalias/getunblah/releases/latest/download/Unblah.dmg">downloaded the appâ€™s latest release (Unblah.dmg)</a> simply double-click the icon to open the volume.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/unblah-in-downloads.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then, in the new window, click and drag Unblah.app into your Applications folder</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/unblah-dmg-installer.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally, use Spotlight to locate the app and open it.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/unblah-spotlight.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you prefer using Finder, navigate over to /Applications and locate the app there.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/unblah-finder.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Should you see an alert that looks similar to this you can safely click on Open to start the app.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/open-app-dialog.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You may have to enable <em>â€œAllow apps downloaded from App Store and identified developersâ€</em> if you havenâ€™t already.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/allow-identified-developers.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>On your first launch, you should see this screen</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/home-screen.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Additionally, since itâ€™s your first launch, you should also see the following permission request for Unblah to access your microphone. Please select â€œOKâ€ here.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/allow-mic-access.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>If youâ€™re concerned about your privacy and the confidentiality of your calls:</em> Unblah DOES NOT RECORD, SAVE or UPLOAD your audio anywhere. All speech analysis happens live, locally and on the fly. This means, the app only operates real-time on the audio stream coming from your microphone to identify your speech. Every few milliseconds these audio-bytes are discarded.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-your-audio-2-minutes">Setting Up Your Audio (2 minutes)</h2>
<p>Here are a few steps you should know about in regards to the audio set up for your calls. None of the steps are really unique to Unblah, but I wanted to make sure youâ€™ve got them covered.</p>

<h3 id="using-headphones">Using Headphones</h3>
<p>As of this release, you will need to have headphones plugged in or turned on before you can start a session (so that Unblah doesnâ€™t trigger recording when others speak.)</p>

<p>So, once youâ€™ve turned on your headphones, click the â€œCheck Headphonesâ€ button to verify youâ€™re set.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/home-screen.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When your headphones are found, you can start a new session by tapping the Play button.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/start-new-session.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="youre-set-up--lets-play">Youâ€™re Set Up â€“ Letâ€™s Play!</h3>

<p>Yay! You should be able to run your first session.</p>

<p><strong>Definitely PLAY around with the app.</strong></p>

<p>See how itâ€™s listening to you and how youâ€™re triggering the appâ€™s speech recognition, even if youâ€™re not on a reall call yet!</p>
