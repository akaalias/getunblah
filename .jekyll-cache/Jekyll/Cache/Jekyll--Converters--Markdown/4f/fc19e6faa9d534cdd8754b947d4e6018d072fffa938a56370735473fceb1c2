I"Ì<p>Hello and welcome!</p>

<p>Alexis here, maker of Unblah with this quick guide on getting started.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-read-this-guide">Why should you read this guide?</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm sharing this guide with you, because I want to set you up for success.</p>

<p>Even though the app is (hopefully) ‚Äúsimple‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt want to assume you would know how to use it.</p>

<p>I want to show you how to install Unblah and set up your audio for your next call.</p>

<p>As of this version, you have to use headphones for Unblah to recognize you talking (a headphones-free version is in the works.)</p>

<p>Next up, the practice of getting live feedback on your talking-time is nuanced and takes some time getting used to (at least for me.) So, I‚Äôll give you some tips and tricks for a quick training session that you can do with a friend or, if you want, jump on a call with me!</p>
