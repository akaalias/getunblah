I"_<p>Hey and welcome, Alexis here.</p>

<p>Great to have you, let’s jump right in getting you set up.</p>

<p>Here are a few steps you should know about in regards to the audio set up for your calls. None of the steps are really unique to Unblah, but I wanted to make sure you’ve got them covered.</p>

<h3 id="using-headphones">Using Headphones</h3>
<p>As of this release, you will need to have headphones plugged in or turned on before you can start a session (so that Unblah doesn’t trigger recording when others speak.)</p>

<p>So, once you’ve turned on your headphones, click the “Check Headphones” button to verify you’re set.</p>

<p>When your headphones are found, you can start a new session by tapping the Play button.</p>

<h3 id="youre-set-up--lets-play">You’re Set Up – Let’s Play!</h3>

<p>Yay! You should be able to run your first session.</p>

<p><strong>Definitely PLAY around with the app.</strong></p>

<p>See how it’s listening to you and how you’re triggering the app’s speech recognition, even if you’re not on a reall call yet!</p>

<h3 id="preparing-a-video-conferencing-call">Preparing a Video Conferencing Call</h3>

<p>You can use Unblah in tandem with most video conference call services, like MS Teams, Zoom, Google Hangouts, WebEx etc.</p>

<p>The basic settings are always the same, but you may have to custom-select your audio input and output as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your audio input (your mic) can be whatever you usually use</li>
  <li>Your audio output (your speakers) MUST be your headphones (so that the app doesn’t trigger when someone else is talking)</li>
</ol>
