I"¨<p>Hello and welcome!</p>

<p>Alexis here, maker of Unblah with this quick guide on getting started.</p>

<p>It has two parts that will set you up for success quickly:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>First</em>, I‚Äôll show you how to get ready with a 2-minute installation/configuration guide.</li>
  <li><em>Secondly</em>, I‚Äôll walk you through your first training session so you‚Äôre comfortable and relaxed for your first session.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-read-this-guide">Why read this guide?</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm writing this guide because I want to set you up for success.</p>

<p>Because, even though the app in its current form is (hopefully) ‚Äúsimple‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to assume you would know how to use it.</p>

<p>I want to show you how to install Unblah and set up your audio for your next call. As of this version, you have to use headphones for Unblah to recognize you talking (a headphones-free version is in the works.)</p>

<p>Also, the practice of getting live feedback on your talking-time is nuanced and takes some time getting used to (at least for me.) So, I‚Äôll give you some tips and tricks for a quick training session that you can do with a friend or, if you want, jump on a call with me!</p>
