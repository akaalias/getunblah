<p>Hey there! Alexis here.</p>

<p>Great to meet you.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a quick installation guide to make sure you‚Äôre ready to go.</p>

<p>If anything, Unblah is just like any other macOS app that you download and install directly from a developer (like me) instead of the App Store.</p>

<p>After you‚Äôve <a href="https://github.com/akaalias/getunblah/releases/latest/download/Unblah.dmg">downloaded the app‚Äôs latest release (Unblah.dmg)</a> simply double-click the icon to open the volume.</p>

<p>Then, in the new window, click and drag Unblah.app into your Applications folder</p>

<p>Finally, use Spotlight to locate the app and open it.</p>

<p>If you prefer using Finder, navigate over to /Applications and locate the app there.</p>

<p>Should you see an alert that looks similar to this you can safely click on Open to start the app.</p>

<p>You may have to enable <em>‚ÄúAllow apps downloaded from App Store and identified developers‚Äù</em> if you haven‚Äôt already.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/allow-identified-developers.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>On your first launch, you should see this screen</p>

<p>Additionally, since it‚Äôs your first launch, you should also see the following permission request for Unblah to access your microphone. Please select ‚ÄúOK‚Äù here.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/allow-mic-access.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>If you‚Äôre concerned about your privacy and the confidentiality of your calls:</em> Unblah DOES NOT RECORD, SAVE or UPLOAD your audio anywhere. All speech analysis happens live, locally and on the fly. This means, the app only operates real-time on the audio stream coming from your microphone to identify your speech. Every few milliseconds these audio-bytes are discarded.</p>
