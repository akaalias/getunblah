I"á<p>Hey there! Alexis here with the â€œget comfortableâ€ guide.</p>

<p>This guide is to help you test the waters of having Unblah coach you by running a â€˜low-stakesâ€™ training session</p>

<p>Note that <em>you donâ€™t have to</em> do a dry-run but itâ€™s something I wish I had done when I first started using Unblah.</p>

<p>Even just starting the app, putting in the headphones, starting the video conferencing tool, selecting the right inputs and outputs takes some getting used to</p>

<p>Then, more importantly, having this new kind of feedback can be difficult to â€œintegrateâ€ at first.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s completely normal if the first few minutes on your first live call are awkward because you may see, for the first time, <em>how short 30 seconds really are</em>!</p>

<p>By doing a quick training session, itâ€™s much easier to get the hang of it</p>

<h2 id="top-priority-do-a-low-stakes-dry-run">Top Priority: Do a â€˜low-stakesâ€™ dry-run</h2>

<p>Schedule an ad-hoc, quick video call with one of your friends. I wrote my friend Tobi a quick message along the lines of.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey Tobi, would you have time today, maybe around lunch for a quick video call? I wanna try something out but I canâ€™t do it alone. 15 minutes max. Let me know and Iâ€™ll send you an invite with the link. Thanks so much!â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Alternatively, I want to offer you my time to get you comfortable.</strong></p>

<p>I figured, the best way is for us to jump on a 15-minute call with you as well!</p>

<p>Iâ€™d love to help you get the hang of this tool, so simply <a href="https://calendly.com/alexis-rondeau/lets-talk">book a time on my Calendly</a> and weâ€™ll see each other shortly.</p>

<h3 id="before-the-call">Before the call</h3>
<p>Once the call is about to startâ€¦</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/v1/get-set-up">Get your headphones set up</a></li>
  <li>Get your callâ€™s audio mic/speakers set up</li>
  <li>Start the Unblah session</li>
  <li>Join the call</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="during-the-call">During the call</h3>
<p>As youâ€™re talking, remember:</p>

<p><strong>This is a dry-run. Itâ€™s okay to feel nervous. Itâ€™s okay to make â€œmistakes.â€</strong></p>

<p>Donâ€™t worry about talking too long or too little. Thatâ€™s the work the app does for you! Over time, and with this kind of practice, youâ€™ll learn to â€˜outsourceâ€™ that worry and re-focus on the conversation.</p>

<p>Simply talk, be yourself, and keep your peripheral vision relaxed enough so that you can notice the timerâ€™s color change.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-handle-the-color-change">How to handle the color change</h4>
<p>In short: Donâ€™t stress. Be kind to yourself.</p>

<p>The colors change in a gradient because there is no â€œfixedâ€ time at which â€œyouâ€™re talking too muchâ€. Itâ€™s a sliding scale.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™re in the â€œredâ€ (around 40+ seconds), think about a way to gracefully transition from talking to maybe asking a question. Or smoothly finishing your sentence and taking a breath before continuing.</p>

<p>If anything, <em>even if</em> find yourself â€œrambling onâ€ just <em>notice</em> that and be kind to yourself before thinking of changing your direction of thought.</p>

<h4 id="leverage-the-timeline">Leverage the timeline</h4>
<p>What I have found invaluable is the timeline at the bottom of the screen. Iâ€™ve used it to direct my and interjections and responses based on how much I have already spoken.</p>

<p>Depending on how much air-time I had occupied in the beginning, I now adjust how much I listen to the other person(s) and try to become more succinct and stay connected in my responses.</p>

<h3 id="after-the-call">After the call</h3>
<p>Once the call is over, I have found that briefly reflecting on how it went.</p>

<p>I keep the app running for a moment longer and use the timeline to see when I stayed â€œon-trackâ€ and when I went â€œoff-the-railsâ€.</p>

<p>This revising has helped me tremendously learn about my patterns and triggers. It also has helped me understand what it means, to me, when a conversation feels â€œgoodâ€ and when it feels lop-sided and what I can do about it in real-time and in my preparations.</p>

<p>Even if youâ€™ve done a dry-run, I still would love to hear from you, so simply <a href="https://calendly.com/alexis-rondeau/lets-talk">book a time on my Calendly</a> and weâ€™ll see each other shortly.</p>
