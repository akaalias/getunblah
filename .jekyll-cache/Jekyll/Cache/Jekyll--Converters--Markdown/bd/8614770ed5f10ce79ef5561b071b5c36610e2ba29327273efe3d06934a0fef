<ul>
  <li>This is a quick guide on getting started with Unblah</li>
  <li>It has two parts that will set you up for success quickly
    <ul>
      <li>First, I‚Äôll show you how to get ready with a 2-minute installation/configuration guide</li>
      <li>Then, I‚Äôll walk you through your first training session so you‚Äôre comfortable and relaxed for your first session</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-does-this-matter-to-me">Why does this matter to ME?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I‚Äôm writing this guide because I want to set you up for success</li>
  <li>Because, even though the app in its current form is (hopefully) ‚Äúsimple‚Äù</li>
  <li>The practice of getting live feedback on your talking-time is nuanced and takes some time getting used to (at least for me.)</li>
  <li>First off I want to show you how to set up your audio for your next call.</li>
  <li>As of this version, you have to use headphones for Unblah to recognize you talking. So I want to make sure you know how to configure your audio settings in Zoom for example</li>
  <li>Please note that I‚Äôm working on an ‚Äòheadphones-free‚Äô version</li>
