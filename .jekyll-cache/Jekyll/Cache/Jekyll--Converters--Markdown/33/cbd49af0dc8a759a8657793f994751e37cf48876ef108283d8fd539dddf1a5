I"Ö<p>Hey and welcome to getting you set up!</p>

<p>Alexis here. Great to have you, let‚Äôs jump right in.</p>

<h2 id="installation-1-minute">Installation (1 minute)</h2>
<p>If anything, Unblah is just like any other macOS app that you download and install directly from a developer (like me) instead of the App Store.</p>

<p>After you‚Äôve <a href="https://github.com/akaalias/getunblah/releases/latest/download/Unblah.dmg">downloaded the app‚Äôs latest release (Unblah.dmg)</a> simply double-click the icon to open the volume: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/unblah-in-downloads.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then, in the new window, click and drag Unblah.app into your Applications folder <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/unblah-dmg-installer.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally, use Spotlight to locate the app and open it. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/unblah-spotlight.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you prefer using Finder, navigate over to /Applications and locate the app there:  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/unblah-finder.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Should you see an alert that looks similar to this you can safely click on Open to start the app.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/open-app-dialog.png" alt="" /></li>
  <li>You may have to enable <em>‚ÄúAllow apps downloaded from App Store and identified developers‚Äù</em> if you haven‚Äôt already. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/allow-identified-developers.png" alt="" /></li>
  <li>On your first launch, you should see this screen: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/home-screen.png" alt="" /></li>
  <li>Additionally, since it‚Äôs your first launch, you should also see the following permission request for Unblah to access your microphone. Please select ‚ÄúOK‚Äù here. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/allow-mic-access.png" alt="" /></li>
  <li><em>If you‚Äôre concerned</em> about your privacy and confidentialy: Unblah DOES NOT RECORD, SAVE or UPLOAD your audio anywhere. All speech analysis happens live, locally and on the fly. This means, the app only operates real-time on the audio stream coming from your microphone to identify your speech. Once analysed, these audio-bytes of yours are discarded.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setting-up-your-audio">Setting Up Your Audio</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Here are a few steps you should know about in regards to the audio set up for your calls</li>
  <li>None of the steps are really unique to Unblah, but I wanted to make sure you‚Äôve got them covered.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="using-headphones">Using Headphones</h3>
<ul>
  <li>As of this release, you will need to have headphones plugged in or turned on before you can start a session (so that Unblah doesn‚Äôt trigger recording when others speak.)</li>
  <li>So, once you‚Äôve turned on your headphones, click the ‚ÄúCheck Headphones‚Äù button to verify you‚Äôre set. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/home-screen.png" alt="" /></li>
  <li>When your headphones are found, you can start a new session by tapping the Play button <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/start-new-session.png" alt="" /></li>
  <li>Yay! You should be able to run your first session <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/getunblah/main/assets/images/unblah-running-session-red.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul>
