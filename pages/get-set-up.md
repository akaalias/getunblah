Hey and welcome to getting you set up!

Alexis here. Great to have you, let's jump right in.

## Installation (1 minute)
If anything, Unblah is just like any other macOS app that you download and install directly from a developer (like me) instead of the App Store.

After you’ve [downloaded the app’s latest release (Unblah.dmg)](https://github.com/akaalias/getunblah/releases/latest/download/Unblah.dmg) simply double-click the icon to open the volume.

Then, in the new window, click and drag Unblah.app into your Applications folder

Finally, use Spotlight to locate the app and open it.

If you prefer using Finder, navigate over to /Applications and locate the app there.

Should you see an alert that looks similar to this you can safely click on Open to start the app.

You may have to enable *“Allow apps downloaded from App Store and identified developers”* if you haven’t already.

On your first launch, you should see this screen

Additionally, since it’s your first launch, you should also see the following permission request for Unblah to access your microphone. Please select “OK” here.

*If you’re concerned about your privacy and the confidentiality of your calls:* Unblah DOES NOT RECORD, SAVE or UPLOAD your audio anywhere. All speech analysis happens live, locally and on the fly. This means, the app only operates real-time on the audio stream coming from your microphone to identify your speech. Every few milliseconds these audio-bytes are discarded.

## Setting Up Your Audio
Here are a few steps you should know about in regards to the audio set up for your calls. None of the steps are really unique to Unblah, but I wanted to make sure you’ve got them covered.

### Using Headphones
As of this release, you will need to have headphones plugged in or turned on before you can start a session (so that Unblah doesn’t trigger recording when others speak.)

So, once you’ve turned on your headphones, click the “Check Headphones” button to verify you’re set.

When your headphones are found, you can start a new session by tapping the Play button.

Yay! You should be able to run your first session. Definitely play around with triggering the app's speech recognition, even if you're not on a reall call yet!
