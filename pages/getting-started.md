## What is this about?
- This is a quick guide on getting started with Unblah
- It has two parts that will set you up for success quickly
    - First, I’ll show you how to get ready with a 2-minute installation/configuration guide
    - Then, I’ll walk you through your first training session so you’re comfortable and relaxed for your first session

## Why does this matter to ME?
- I’m writing this guide because I want to set you up for success
- Because, even though the app in its current form is (hopefully) “simple”
- The practice of getting live feedback on your talking-time is nuanced and takes some time getting used to (at least for me.)
- First off I want to show you how to set up your audio for your next call.
- As of this version, you have to use headphones for Unblah to recognize you talking. So I want to make sure you know how to configure your audio settings in Zoom for example
- Please note that I’m working on an ‘headphones-free’ version

## How can I show this?

- Get Comfortable: [Part 2: How to get comfortable (15 minutes)](/v1/get-comfortable)
