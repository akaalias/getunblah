Hello and welcome!

Alexis here, I'm the maker of Unblah and is a quick guide for you to get started. 

## Why should you read this guide?
I’m sharing this guide with you, because I want to set you up for success.

Even though the app is (hopefully) “simple”, I didn’t want to assume you would know how to use it.

I want to show you how to install Unblah and set up your audio for your next call. 

As of this version, you have to use headphones for Unblah to recognize you talking (a headphones-free version is in the works.) 

Next up, the practice of getting live feedback on your talking-time is nuanced and takes some time getting used to (at least for me.) So, I’ll give you some tips and tricks for a quick training session that you can do with a friend or, if you want, jump on a call with me!

## Next Up

Follow along in [Part 1 – Get set up (2 minutes, required)](/v1/get-set-up).
