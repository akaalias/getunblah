            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">Does this app record or store my audio?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Unblah DOES NOT RECORD, SAVE or UPLOAD your audio anywhere. All speech analysis happens live, locally and on the fly. This means, the app only operates real-time on the audio stream coming from your microphone to identify your speech. Every few milliseconds these audio-bytes are discarded.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">Does this app send my audio into the cloud for analysis?</div>
                <div class="answer">No it doesnt. All the speech detection is done locally and “on-the-metal.“” In fact, the app is fully functional, even without internet access. You could be offline and still have it listen in on a regular phone call.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">Do I need to sign-up before I can try?</div>
                <div class="answer">Nope, no email-required-for-download and no sign-up required after launch. It's completely  self-contained and works right out the box.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">Are there any in-app purchases to “unlock” the full version?</div>
                <div class="answer">Nope. What you see in terms of features is what you get.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">Is this app sending any sort of tracking/user-analytics events?</div>
                <div class="answer">Nope. No tracking/analytics installed and not planning to.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">Is this yet another “nAtIvE” Electron app?</div>
