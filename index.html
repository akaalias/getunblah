        <div class="faq" id="coworker">
            <div class="question">
                I have this person on my team who talks WAY too much and never notices it. They LOVE hearing themselves talk and never shut up. Should I tell them to get this app?                </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    First off: I believe your struggle with this person is 100% real. I fully believe their behavior is affecting you negatively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, my answer is <b>a STRONG NO.</b> Please don’t use Unblah as a proxy for a difficult conversation that sounds like it needs to be had.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think about it: They would never use it anyways, because, as you’re saying yourself <i>“...and never even notice it.”</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They don't have a problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't know how much rapport you two have, how much safe space you can create for resolving this situation, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, to keep everyone safe, please check with HR or leadership on how to best deal with this situation if it impacts you, your team and your performance.
                </p>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">Does this app record or store my audio?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Unblah does not record or store your audio. All speech classification happens live and on the fly. This means, the app only operates real-time on the audio stream coming from your microphone to identify your speech. Every few milliseconds these audio-bytes are discarded.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">Does this app send my audio into the cloud for analysis?</div>
                <div class="answer">Nope. All sound classification is done locally and "on-the-metal." In fact, the app is fully functional, even without internet access. You could be offline and still have it listen in on a regular phone call.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">Can this app "understand" (or even <i>judge</i>) what I'm saying?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    No. The app has no concept of "words" or "sentences" or "ideas." It only operates in terms of probabilities of <i>"Is someone talking?"</i>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">Do I need to sign-up before I can give it a spin?</div>
                <div class="answer">Nope, there's no sign-up required. Unblah is completely self-contained and works right out the box.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">Are there any in-app purchases to “unlock” the full version?</div>
                <div class="answer">Nope. What you see in terms of features is what you get.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">Is this app sending any sort of tracking/user-analytics events?</div>
                <div class="answer">Nope. No tracking/analytics installed and not planning to.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">What is the app made of?</div>
                <div class="answer">It’s written 100% in Swift and Objective-C.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">If it's soooo cool, then WHY ON EARTH are you giving it away?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                        It's a personal project that I built for myself. It solves a real pain-point I noticed in my life.
                        If you experience the struggle, I hope it helps you as well as it has helped me!
                    </p>

            <div class="faq">
                <div class="question">I know <i>exactly</i> 'the struggle' you're describing. Do you have time to talk?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                        Yes, I'd love that. Sharing Unblah really is an invitation <a href="https://calendly.com/alexis-rondeau/lets-talk" target="_blank">to start a conversation with those affected directly</a>.
                        Let's talk about your personal experience. Let's talk about what works and what doesn't and why that is.
                        Let's discuss what collaboration, meetings, communication, leadership mean and could be.
                        Let's explore that hairball of anxiety, confidence, dominance, mental health, and neurodiversity.
